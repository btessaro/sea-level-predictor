# Sea Level Predictor ðŸŒŠ 

Final project for the **Data Analysis with Python** course offered by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-course). 

You can check my certificate [here](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc2a39db6b-7401-45ce-9f42-82b2673914c5/data-analysis-with-python-v7).

In this project I analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880, and use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

Unfortunately, the sea level is predicted to increase from about 7inches in 2000 to 15inches by 2050. It is a considerably higher than average increase considering it has been steadly and slowly increasing about 2 inches every 25 years since 1875, which is the timeframe of the data we have.
This means that there is an acceleration of increase and something needs to be done. 

Ps This result corroborates [NASA's prediction](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3232/nasa-study-rising-sea-level-could-exceed-estimates-for-us-coasts/#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20sea%20level%20along,three%20decades%20of%20satellite%20observations).
